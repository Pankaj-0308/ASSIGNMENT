cd mini-linkedin-platform
---

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install root dependencies
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `backend/config.env` file with the following variables:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your-username:your-password@cluster.mongodb.net/Linkedin?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
NODE_ENV=development
```

**Important:** Replace the MongoDB URI with your actual database connection string.

### 4. Create Upload Directory
```bash
# Create uploads directory for image storage
mkdir backend/uploads
```

### 5. Start the Application

#### Development Mode (Recommended)
```bash

npm run dev
```

#### Production Mode
```bash

npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```



### Creating Admin Users
Currently, all users have the same permissions. To create admin functionality:

1. Register a new user through the UI

Error: MongoNetworkError: failed to connect to server
```
**Solution: Check your MongoDB URI and ensure MongoDB is running.

```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::5000
```
**Solution:** Kill the process using the port or change the PORT in config.env.

#### Image Upload Issues
```
Error: LIMIT_FILE_SIZE

Solution: Ensure images are under 5MB and in supported formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF).

#### CORS Errors
```
